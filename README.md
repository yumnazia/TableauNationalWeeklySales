### 1.	Top 10 brands in terms of sales being made for 2016 -2017 period.

According to the analysis on the national weekly sales data for 2016 and 2017, these were the top 10 brands (apart from the ‘all other brands,’ it is a combination of number of products sold for all less renown brands), with Nike being the top most.

Also, there are many bands in the database but I found out that most of the best-selling brands are related to sports? (For example, Nike, Adidas, Under Armour, Jordan, Asics, etc.). Our conclusion is that this retail store is focusing on sports lovers and according to our data, people living in US are likely to spend more money on sports stuff.

### 2.	Number of sales made for each target buyer (gender) category.

According to the data, ASICS is the most popular brand when it comes to shopping for men and Brooks is the highest preferredbrand for women.

According to data, the most preferred brand for unisex products is Road Runner Sports (RRS corresponds to the same brand).

### Overall observations: 
As compared to Male & Female products, Unisex products are much more popular as compared to individual male and female products. The number of products sold for this category are around 2 times the number of Male products and Female products sold.

Seasonal pattern appears in the run chart. Third quarter is the best-selling season for all kinds of products. From the Run-Chart, we can see that variance for unisex products is much more than others.

As I looked into best selling brands websites, I found that ASICS has used women as models for their products meaning they want to target female customers. We also looked into Brook’s website and found out that their website is not very visually attractive, they haven’t posted any sports star pictures and have just listed down their products on the main page, therefore, we can expect ASICS to beat Brooks in the near future. 

### 3.	Top 10 states in terms of products being returned for both 2016 and 2017 in US

The most number of products returned were for the region of California which is double the number of products returned by customers in New York.
